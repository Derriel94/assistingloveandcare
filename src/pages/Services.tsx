					<h4>24hour Home Care</h4>
					<img className="home-img" src="./bedside.jpg"/>
					<p> 
						In this type of care arrangement, 
						our caregiver stays with the individual 
						around the clock, ensuring their safety, 
						well-being, and comfort at all times. 
						The caregiver is available 24 hours a day, 
						seven days a week(depending on arrangement), 
						providing personalized care and 
						assistance with daily activities, 
						medical needs, mobility, meal preparation, 
						medication management, and emotional support.
						This level of care is often required for individuals 
						who need constant monitoring due to age-related issues, 
						chronic illnesses, disabilities, or post-surgery recovery. 
						24-hour home care allows the person to remain in familiar 
						surroundings, preserving their independence and dignity 
						while receiving the necessary support for their specific needs. 
						It is an excellent alternative to assisted living facilities 
						or nursing homes for those who prefer to stay in 
						their homes but require ongoing care and supervision.

				<h2>Testimonial</h2>
				<p>	Britteny is a wonderful care giver who goes above and beyond.  
					I took care of my father at night and Brittny came at 4 am so 
					I could be at work on time.  I also worked very long hours I 
					would leave at 0400, and usually not get back to relieve her 
					at 9pm.
					That is a lot to ask of a caregiver, and she always showed 
					up and was in a pleasant mood even at 4 am.  My father adored 
					her.  My father had dementia and wasn’t easy to take care of 
					and again, she went above and beyond and never complained.  
					I also found her rates very reasonable, I was expecting to 
					pay much more to ask her to come so early and stay so late.  
					I did look around at other caregiver companies and compare rates. 
					She’s worth far more than she charged.
					You can’t really put a price on your piece of mind. 
					When I had to leave my dad, I never worried or were concerned 
					that he wasn’t getting what he needed.  She fed him, occasionally 
					even cooking.  She made sure he was safe walking around on his 
					walker, she made sure he got his medicine and she had to
					occasionally clean him up.  The sicker he got, the more “accidents” 
					he had.  I think my father preferred her care to mine.
					I am not nearly sure as patient as  Brittany is.  Her care for my 
					father, and the other caregiver were a godsend.  Before I found them, 
					had no idea how I was going to keep my father out of a nursing home.  
					I had to work or we wouldn’t make it financially, and I have a great 
					job, but it‘s 2 hours away from my father’s house.
					Because of Brittney’s wonderful care, I was able to keep my 
					father in his own home (where he wanted to be) and I was able 
					to keep him from  a nursing home.  I know there are wonderful 
					nursing homes, and my father stayed in one for a few weeks.
					It was a good place, but he wanted to be home, 
					wondering around his house and fixing his flags.
					He had three flags in front of his house that were his pride and joy. He would want to be out there making sure they were clean and hanging correctly, anyway Britteny put up with him and his flag checking several times a day.  My father hardly napped or stood still. So, there was no sitting or watching tv.  Britteny had to follow him around all day making sure he didn’t fall and talking him in to eating or taking his pills.
					I know I’m writing a diatribe, but I wanted to let her future clients know what a caring and kind caregiver she is.  It easy to just say that, but I believe my detailed account’s and examples will really give you the more detailed information so you can make the right decision and choose the right caregiver for you or your loved ones.  It’s a major decision and not getting what you need can be trying, and making the wrong decision can have some detrimental effects.
					I promise that you won’t have to worry about your loved one if Brittany is who you choose. 
					My last year my father was really wonderful.  With out Britteny‘s care, I don’t think it would have been nearly as good.
					I will never forget Britteny and the other care giver’s care.  I wasn’t able to get much help from relatives for various reason’s, so Brittany and the other care givers became our family that last year.
						
						- A very grateful daughter.</p>
