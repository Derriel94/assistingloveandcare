					<h4>24hour Home Care</h4>
					<img className="home-img" src="./bedside.jpg"/>
					<p> 
						In this type of care arrangement, 
						our caregiver stays with the individual 
						around the clock, ensuring their safety, 
						well-being, and comfort at all times. 
						The caregiver is available 24 hours a day, 
						seven days a week(depending on arrangement), 
						providing personalized care and 
						assistance with daily activities, 
						medical needs, mobility, meal preparation, 
						medication management, and emotional support.
						This level of care is often required for individuals 
						who need constant monitoring due to age-related issues, 
						chronic illnesses, disabilities, or post-surgery recovery. 
						24-hour home care allows the person to remain in familiar 
						surroundings, preserving their independence and dignity 
						while receiving the necessary support for their specific needs. 
						It is an excellent alternative to assisted living facilities 
						or nursing homes for those who prefer to stay in 
						their homes but require ongoing care and supervision.
